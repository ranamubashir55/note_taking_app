I successfully integrated ChatGPT with LangChain by utilizing the LangChain library.
First, I initialized the OpenAI language model, configuring parameters such as temperature and providing the necessary API key.
Then, I employed the PromptTemplate functionality from LangChain, dynamically taking user input and inserting it into the template.

The crucial step involved passing the formatted prompt, with the user's input, to the OpenAI language model instance.
This resulted in the generation of a text summary. However, during the development process, I encountered a rate limit issue, which I resolved by upgrading to the Tier 1 API.
